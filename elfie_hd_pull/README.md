# JJRC ELFIE H37/H47 (HD version) video streaming

Kind of based on [wadria.junyent-ferre's project](https://hackaday.io/project/19680-controlling-a-jjrc-h37-elfie-quad-from-a-pc)

[TomE8](https://github.com/TomE8/drones/) did much better job than me, you can even control the drone, but i have discovered that much later.
Anyway, with this you can just play the stream in vlc - only change needed is to inform vlc that it has to use h264 demux
